## 🚫 The Rule: NEVER Commit Generated Artifacts

Under no circumstances should any generated artifact, compiled binary, test result, test report, or temporary test data ever be committed to the Git repository.

### What is Forbidden?
- **Test Results & Reports:** Any outputs from test runs, such as HTML reports, coverage data, JSON summaries, `.test-report.*`, or CSV results.
- **Compiled Binaries & Executables:** `.exe`, `.dll`, `.so`, `.dylib`, `.out`, `.class`, or any pre-compiled binaries resulting from a build step.
- **Build Directories:** `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `dist/` (unless explicitly allowed for a specific deployment pipeline in a separate spec).
- **Temporary Data:** Any mock data, database dumps, or local logs generated during a local run.

### Why?
1. **Repository Bloat:** Binary files and continuous test reports exponentially increase the Git repository size, slowing down clones and pulls for all team members and CI/CD pipelines.
2. **Noise in History:** Committing transient data pollutes the Git history and diffs, making it impossible to perform meaningful code reviews.
3. **Security Risks:** Test results or compiled binaries can accidentally leak sensitive environment data, secrets, or internal architectural layouts.

## AI Agent Directives

> 🛑 **MANDATORY INSTRUCTION FOR AI:**
>
> If you are instructed to run a test suite, compile a binary, or execute a script that produces an output file, you MUST NOT commit those outputs to the Git repository.
> 
> If you notice that an action you performed has generated a new test report or binary, you must ensure that it is either ignored via `.gitignore` or deleted before you stage files using `git add`.
> 
> **Never blindly run `git add .` without verifying that generated artifacts are safely ignored.**

## Enforcement
This rule is enforced globally via `.gitignore` patterns. If a new type of artifact is introduced, you must update `.gitignore` before committing anything else.
