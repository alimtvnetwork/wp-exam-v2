# CI/CD Pipeline Workflows

**Version:** 3.1.0  
**Updated:** 2026-04-16  
**AI Confidence:** Production-Ready  
**Ambiguity:** None

---

## Purpose

Central location for all CI/CD pipeline specifications, deployment automation, and related infrastructure-as-code documentation. All pipeline-related content — build pipelines, deployment workflows, environment promotion strategies, and CI/CD tooling configurations — MUST be documented in this folder.

---

## Scope

This module covers two distinct pipeline archetypes, shared conventions, and cross-cutting concerns:

| Archetype | Subfolder | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Browser Extension Deploy | `01-browser-extension-deploy/` | Node.js/pnpm multi-component builds, zip packaging, Chrome Web Store |
| Go Binary Deploy | `02-go-binary-deploy/` | Cross-compiled Go binaries, tar.gz/zip, install scripts, code signing |
| Shared | Root files | Common patterns used across all pipeline types |

---

## Placement Rules

```
AI INSTRUCTION:

1. ALL CI/CD and pipeline content belongs in this folder (spec/12-cicd-pipeline-workflows/).
2. This is a Core Fundamentals folder (range 01–20) — no app-specific content here.
3. App-specific deployment notes go in 21-app/ instead.
4. Each pipeline spec file follows the standard {NN}-{kebab-case-name}.md naming convention.
5. Add new files to the Feature Inventory below and update 99-consistency-report.md.
6. Shared patterns (version resolution, checksums, release creation) go in root-level files.
7. Archetype-specific patterns go in the appropriate subfolder.
```
