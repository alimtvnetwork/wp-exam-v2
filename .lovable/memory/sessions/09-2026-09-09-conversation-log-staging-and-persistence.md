## 1. Session Overview

This session spanned:
1. Consolidation and review of previous engineering cycles (leaf enums, completed plans consolidation, split SQLite logging, task retention, errcmd streaming, atomic file writes, and ApiManager spec).
2. Execution of the **Conversation Log & Context Wrapper** workflow.
3. Execution of the **Memory Persistence & Issue Logging** workflow.

## 2. Key Actions Taken

### 2.1 Conversation History Persistence

- Created directory `conversation/`.
- Authored 4 sequential conversation logs:
  - `conversation/001-enum-architecture-and-cycle-elimination.md` (Turns 1–2).
  - `conversation/002-memory-consolidation-and-milestones.md` (Turn 3).
  - `conversation/003-split-sqlite-logging-and-migration.md` (Turns 4–8).
  - `conversation/004-task-retention-streaming-atomic-apimanager.md` (Turns 9–11).

### 2.2 Prompt Staging & Registry Indexing

- Authored rewritten prompt `prompts/001-conversation-log-and-context-wrapper.md`.
- Appended table entry into `01-prompts/01-prompt-library-setup/01-prompt-library-setup.md`.
- Maintained zero-execution staging boundary and reported back to the user with the mandatory acknowledgment.

### 2.3 Memory Persistence & Consolidation

- Authored learned memories:
  - `.ai-memory/memory/learned/07-split-sqlite-logging-and-task-db-migration.md`
  - `.ai-memory/memory/learned/08-task-retention-streaming-atomic-apimanager.md`
  - `.ai-memory/memory/learned/09-conversation-log-and-context-wrapper-protocol.md`
- Authored standards & workflow memories:
  - `.ai-memory/memory/standards/06-coding-guidelines-mirror.md`
  - `.ai-memory/memory/workflow/03-conversation-log-and-context-wrapper.md`
- Appended non-duplicate rules to `.ai-memory/strictly-avoid.md`.
- Updated `.ai-memory/memory/01-index.md` and `.ai-memory/what-to-read.md`.
- Verified root `readme.md` is strictly lowercase and synced.

## 3. Quality Gates Verification

- Ran `python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`.
- Result: 36/36 quality gates passed (exit code 0).
