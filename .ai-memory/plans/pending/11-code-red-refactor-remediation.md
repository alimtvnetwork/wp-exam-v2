# Phase 14: Code Red Refactor Remediation

Status: Pending
Slug: 14-code-red-refactor-remediation

## Intent

Remediate Code Red enum, boolean, and query wrapper violations across the codebase, ensuring strict compliance with the `.ai-memory` memory and `spec` guidelines.

## Tasks

1. Audit and replace inverted success checks (`!isSuccess`, `isSuccess === false`) with explicit failure checks (`isFail`).
2. Audit and replace TypeScript string union types with explicit Enums ending in `Type`.
3. Remove all magic strings and numbers unless explicitly used for logging (with proper typing).
4. Create query wrappers for PHP, Python, and TypeScript that automatically log failures to avoid scattered logging code.
5. Ensure all `try-catch` blocks log errors according to `02-spec/03-error-manage` guidelines.
6. Verify CI/CD builds and tests pass.
7. Update `.ai-memory/memory/` with these new wrapper, error management, and enum rules.
