# Repository Context & AI Architecture Index

> **Version:** 4.0.0
> **Target:** `.ai-memory/01-index.md`
> **Purpose:** Master repository index, directory router, and operational architecture guide for AI agents.

## 1. Repository Architecture Overview

This repository is a **specification-driven documentation and automation system** designed for multi-language software engineering environments (Go, Rust, Python, TypeScript, PHP, C#, SQL). It consists of:

- **Formal Specifications (`02-spec/`):** Layered hierarchy of 20 core fundamental modules and application modules covering coding guidelines, error management envelopes, database patterns, CLI contracts, design systems, and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Persistent AI Fix Toolchain (`03-ai-scripts/`):** Ultra-fast, dual-platform Python automation engine providing deterministic file manipulation, path sanitization, naming validation, and local CI verification.
- **Institutional Memory (`.ai-memory/memory/`):** Long-term cognitive storage tracking system architecture decisions, non-negotiable constraints, and root cause analyses.
- **Plan & Micro-Task Engine (`.ai-memory/plans/`):** Bounded task decomposition center (`pending/`, `subtasks/`, `completed/`).
- **Interactive Documentation Viewer (`src/`):** Modern React docs application with live search, tree navigation, and slide presentation capabilities.

## 2. Directory Navigation Router

| Location | Purpose | Key Entrypoint |
|---|---|---|
| `02-spec/` | Formal cross-language specifications & standards | `02-02-spec/01-index.md` |
| `03-ai-scripts/` | Reusable high-speed Python automation toolchain | `03-ai-scripts/01-index.md` |
| `.ai-memory/memory/` | Institutional knowledge base & CODE RED constraints | `.ai-memory/memory/01-index.md` |
| `.ai-memory/plans/` | Active roadmap, parent task specs & subtasks | `.ai-memory/plans/01-index.md` |
| `01-prompts/` | Prompt categories and compiled workflow prompts | `01-prompts/` |
| `.ai-memory/folder-structure.md` | Canonical folder structure & sequence ID rules | `.ai-memory/folder-structure.md` |
| `.ai-memory/strictly-avoid.md` | Universal hard prohibitions & negative constraints | `.ai-memory/strictly-avoid.md` |
| `.ai-memory/suggestions.md` | Architecture suggestions & enhancement proposals | `.ai-memory/suggestions.md` |

## 3. Core Universal Rules (CODE RED)

Violations of these principles are blocking:

1. **Never Swallow Errors:** Every error must be explicitly logged, handled, or wrapped in an application error envelope (`AppError`).
2. **Zero Nesting (Flatten Conditionals):** Strictly avoid 4+ level nested `if` pyramids. Use shallow guard clauses and fast substring pre-filters.
3. **Implicit Positive Booleans:** NEVER compare booleans explicitly against `true` (`if is_ready:` mandatory; `if is_ready == True:` forbidden).
4. **Mandatory Boolean Prefixes:** All boolean variables, fields, and functions MUST use positive prefixes (`is_`, `has_`, `can_`, `should_`).
5. **Strict Relative Git Paths:** All links, markdown paths, and references must be relative to the repository root. Absolute paths (`C:\...`, `/home/...`, `file:///...`) are strictly prohibited.
6. **Strict Lowercase File Naming:** All files, scripts, and documentation must use lowercase naming (`01-index.md`, `02-shared-engine.py`).
7. **Quality Gate Verification:** Before completing any work session, run `python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py` to confirm all 18 quality checks pass.

## 4. AI Operational Reading Sequence

1. `.ai-memory/01-index.md` → Understand repository scope and directory navigation.
2. `.ai-memory/strictly-avoid.md` → Load hard prohibitions and negative constraints.
3. `.ai-memory/02-user-preferences` → Align with user communication preferences.
4. `.ai-memory/memory/01-index.md` → Survey institutional knowledge and architectural decisions.
5. `.ai-memory/plans/01-index.md` → Review active plans and current task bounds.
