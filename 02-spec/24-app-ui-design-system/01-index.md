### AC-ADS-001: App design-system conformance: Index

**Given** Scan app UI for raw colors and untokenized spacing; render Storybook (or equivalent) snapshot suite.
**When** Run the verification command shown below.
**Then** All components consume semantic tokens; snapshot diff is empty in light and dark themes.

**Verification command:**

```bash
npm run lint && npm run test
```

**Expected:** exit 0. Any non-zero exit is a hard fail and blocks merge.
