# App Issues

> **/goal** Master and enforce the architectural standards, specifications, and CI/CD validation rules for 22 App Issues.
> **/learn** Read the sequentially ordered specification files in this directory, follow the actionable CI/CD checklist, and apply mandatory rules before generating code.

## 🎯 Actionable CI/CD & Agent Checklist

- [ ] `/goal` Read and understand all numbered specifications under `22-app-issues/`.
- [ ] `/learn` Adhere strictly to `.ai-memory/folder-structure.md` and `.ai-memory/strictly-avoid.md`.
- [ ] `/goal` Verify zero explicit `true` boolean evaluations and no mixed-polarity conditionals.
- [ ] `/learn` Run all local verification linters via `python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`.

## Overview

App-specific issue analysis, root-cause analysis, bug documentation, and solution guidance — for whatever project this repo ships. Whether the app is a web app, Chrome extension, browser plugin, CLI tool, mobile app, WordPress plugin, or desktop app, **its bug reports and post-mortems live here.**

This folder tracks problems encountered during application development, their diagnosis, and their resolution.

---

## Placement Rule

Any content that analyzes bugs, failures, root causes, or fixes for application-level work belongs here, regardless of the app's runtime. General coding-principle violations or cross-cutting concerns belong in the core fundamentals range (`01–20`).

### AC-AI-001: App issues triage conformance: Index

**Given** Audit issue write-ups for the required Reproduction / Cause / Fix / Prevention sections.
**When** Run the verification command shown below.
**Then** Every issue file contains all four sections and references at least one commit or PR.

**Verification command:**

```bash
python3 linter-scripts/check-spec-cross-links.py --root spec --repo-root .
```

**Expected:** exit 0. Any non-zero exit is a hard fail and blocks merge.
