# App DB

> **/goal** Master and enforce the architectural standards, specifications, and CI/CD validation rules for 23 App Db.
> **/learn** Read the sequentially ordered specification files in this directory, follow the actionable CI/CD checklist, and apply mandatory rules before generating code.

## 🎯 Actionable CI/CD & Agent Checklist

- [ ] `/goal` Read and understand all numbered specifications under `23-app-db/`.
- [ ] `/learn` Adhere strictly to `.ai-memory/folder-structure.md` and `.ai-memory/strictly-avoid.md`.
- [ ] `/goal` Verify zero explicit `true` boolean evaluations and no mixed-polarity conditionals.
- [ ] `/learn` Run all local verification linters via `python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`.

## Purpose

Application-specific database (App DB) specifications for whatever project this repo ships — web app, Chrome extension, CLI, plugin, mobile app, etc. Covers the app's data model, table designs, migration strategies, query patterns, and any database decisions unique to this application. Complements the core `04-database-conventions/` (general naming/schema rules) and `05-split-db-architecture/` (SQLite partitioning) with app-specific schema details.

## Verification

_Auto-generated section — see `02-spec/23-app-db/97-acceptance-criteria.md` for the full criteria index._

### AC-ADB-001: App-database conformance: Index

**Given** Validate app database migrations against the schema-design rules.
**When** Run the verification command shown below.
**Then** Migrations are forward-only; PascalCase naming is preserved; new columns are nullable with no DEFAULT (Rule 12).

**Verification command:**

```bash
python3 linter-scripts/check-forbidden-strings.py
```

**Expected:** exit 0. Any non-zero exit is a hard fail and blocks merge.
